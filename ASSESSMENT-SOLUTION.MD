## Remarks
1. I have chosen to leave some data in the feature files (e.g."The app is open on "localhost"). My personal preference would be to leave out this data, so that scenarios become more readable and unserstandable to stakeholders who are less technical and/or know less details about the system (e.g. "The app is opened"). I would be happy to discuss the pros and cons of different the different approaches.

## Solution
The solution is based on a BDD approach using the following tools:
* Webstorm IDE
* Protractor
* Cucumber

The system that was used is:
* MacBook Pro
* macOS Catalina 10.15.6
* Chrome

1. The 'E2E' folder already contained a 'features' and 'steps' folder
2. To the 'E2E' folder I have added a 'pages' folder that is used for the pageobjects
3. The 'search-people.feature' and 'search-planets.feature' are added to the 'features' folder
4. The 'searchpage.po.ts' is added to the 'pages' folder
5. Based on the main features the feature files are enriched with scenarios
6. Based on the steps in the scenarios, the step definition files are enriched
7. Based on the frontend of the application the pageobject file is enriched with element locators
8. Created the folder 'test-reports' because I got an error that this folder was expected
9. The 'protractor.conf.js' contained an incorrect path to the specs. This has been changed from `./e2e/features/*/*.feature` to `'./e2e/features/*.feature'`
10. Running the 'E2E' test then resulted in the following error `Error: When config.framework is custom, config.frameworkPath is required.`. This has been fixed by installing `Protractor Cucumber Framework` and adding the correct path to the file 'protractor.conf.js'.
